    "Fittingly, this viewer displays a set of records in a table format.\n  \n"+
    "You may filter/search the table via the search box. The table will display a subset of the records that match the filter criterion",
    "### Filtering the Table\n"+
    "The table will show records matching each space-delimited term in the query string.\n"+
    "For example, the query:  \n\n"+
    "    foo bar\n"+
    "will only display records where at least one string column contains 'foo' and at least one string column contains 'bar' (case insensitive).\n  \n"+

    "    column_1=foo column_2=bar\n"+
    "Here we only wish to show records where the value of column_1 is exactly 'foo' (case sensitive) and the value of column_2 is exactly 'bar'.\n  \n"+
    "There are several column comparison operators:  \n\n"+
    "    = exact string match or numeric equality\n"+
    "    < or > alphabetic, numeric or date comparison (dates are like 2015-01-01@23:00)\n"+
    "    ~ case-insensitive regular expression match\n"+
    "This last is extremely powerful (if you know regular expressions), but is most often useful for doing case-insensitive matches within a column (i.e., not exact strings), for example, column_1~foo.\n\n"+
    "By combining terms we can generate more precise subsets of the table for export. For example the query:\n\n"+
    "    sample_name~CRC date_of_surgery>2012-01-06@12:20\n"+
    "can reduce a set of sample records to a given date and indication range."

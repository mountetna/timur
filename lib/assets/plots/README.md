This is plot data use by the view. They have been extracted from the old view database entries and formatted to comply with the new plot structure. When you use the rake task: 

`$ bundler exec rake load_view_manifests[USER ID]`

it will associate the correct manifest with the correct plot.

These items are not generated by any of the rake tasks so please do not delete them until the far future. Due to the data for these plots being spread over the DB and view files I had to manually compile these items by hand.
